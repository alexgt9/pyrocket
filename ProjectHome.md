**pyrocket** is used to operate USB foam dart launchers. It supports many models,
and for some, has considerably more functionality than the drivers provided by
the manufacturer. One may find it useful as a starting point for controlling
other USB devices, or just for waging cubicle warfare.

pyrocket automatically detects the launcher(s) and a joystick, and a video
window is provided for webcam-enabled devices. pyrocket currently supports the
"circus cannon", "original" and "webcam" USB Missile Launchers sold by _Dream
Cheeky_, as well as the _Striker II USB Laser Guided Missile Launcher_ marketed
by _Ninja Gizmos_.

If you are using Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install pyrocket
```
A menu entry will appear in Applications->Games.
